I really couldn't decide how I wanted to host a blog for me to rant and talk
about software development. I looked at Tumblr and Medium but code snippets are
a feature I really want to take advantage of. I looked at
[Dev.to](https://dev.to) but... I don't really like their font...It's a great
place don't get me wrong, I just don't like font they're using. I'm very
particular about that kinda thing.

So Jekyll on GitHub Pages it is.

I'm uhh, gonna eventually add content here. Someday.
